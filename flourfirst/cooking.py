    Step_1 = (
       'When you want to bake a loaf of artisan bread,' 
       'dust a pizza peel or a baking sheet turned upside'
       'down with cornmeal or line it with parchment paper.' 
       'Grab a hunk of the dough and use a serrated knife' 
       'or scissors to cut off a 1-pound piece of dough.' 
       'Hold the dough in your hands and, if necessary,' 
       'add just enough flour so the dough doesn’t stick' 
       'to your hands. (What you’re trying to do is surround' 
       'the surface of the dough with flour so that it can' 
       'be handled. You are not trying to incorporate more' 
       'flour into the dough, so for the love of all things' 
       'good, resist the temptation to get rid of all the' 
       'dough’s inherent and lovely stickiness by working' 
       'the flour into the dough.)' 
       'Gently stretch the surface of the dough,' 
       'tucking the ends underneath the ball and rotating it' 
       'a quarter turn as you go. Most of the dusting flour' 
       'will fall off, and that’s okay, because as we just said,' 
       'it’s not intended to be incorporated into the dough.' 
       'The bottom of the ball of dough may appear to be a' 
       'collection of bunched ends, but it will flatten out' 
       'and adhere during resting and baking.' 
       'Your round loaf of bread should be smooth and cohesive,' 
       'and the entire shaping process should take no more than' 
       '20 to 40 seconds—don’t work the dough any longer or your' 
       'loaves may be dense. Place the shaped ball of dough on' 
       'the prepared pizza peel and let it rest for about 40 minutes.' 
       'It doesn’t need to be covered.' 
       'You may not see much rise during this period, but don’t fret.' 
       'It will rise much more during baking.'
        )

    Step_2 = (
        'Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C) for at least' 
        '20 to 30 minutes.' 
        'Preheat a baking stone on a middle rack for' 
        'at least 20 to 30 minutes.' 
        'Place an empty metal broiler tray on any rack' 
        'that won’t interfere with the rising bread.' 
        '(Do not use a glass pan as it could shatter.)'
        )
    
    Step_3 = (
        'Dust the top of the raised loaf generously with' 
        'flour and, using a serrated bread knife,' 
        'slash a 1/2-inch-deep cross or tic-tac-toe pattern' 
        'in the top.' 
        'There’s no need to dust the flour off the loaf.'
        )

    Step_4 = (
        'Place the far edge of the peel or the upside-down' 
        'baking sheet in the oven on the baking stone a' 
        'few inches beyond where you want the bread to land.' 
        'Give the peel or baking sheet a couple' 
        'quick back-and-forth jiggles and then abruptly pull' 
        'it out from under the loaf.' 
        'The loaf should land on the baking stone with' 
        'very little drama.' 
        'Quickly but carefully pour about 1 cup hot water' 
        'into the broiler tray and immediately shut' 
        'the oven door to trap the steam.' 
        'Bake the bread for a total of 20 to 35 minutes,' 
        'until the crust is richly browned and firm to the touch.' 
        '(Don’t worry. Because the dough is so wet,' 
        'there’s very little risk of it becoming dry' 
        'despite how dark the crust may become.)' 
        'And crazily enough, a perfectly baked loaf will' 
        'audibly crackle, or “sing,” when initially exposed' 
        'to room temperature. Let the loaf cool completely,' 
        'preferably on a wire rack for the best flavor,' 
        'texture, and slicing.' 
        'The crust may initially soften but will firm when cooled.'
        )
