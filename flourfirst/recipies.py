    Step_1 = (
        '1. Warm the 3 cups water just a little so that'
        'it feels just slightly warmer than body temperature.'
        'That should put it at about 100°F (40°C).'
        'In the large bowl of a standing mixer or a 6-quart'
        'container with a lid, mix the yeast, warm water, and salt.'
        'Don’t worry about getting the yeast to dissolve.'
        'Add the flour all at once, then use a spoon or stand mixer'
        'to mix until the flour is completely incorporated and you'
        'have a blobby dough. (If you’re hand-mixing the dough and'
        'it becomes too difficult to incorporate all the flour with'
        'the spoon, just use very wet hands to press the mixture together.)'
        'Don’t knead the dough! It’s not necessary. You just want the'
        'dough to be uniformly wet and loose enough to conform to the'
        'shape of its container. All you need to do is be certain that'
        'there are no dry patches of flour.'
        )

    Step_2 = (
        '2. Loosely cover the container and let the dough hang out at'
        'room temperature until it begins to rise and collapse or at'
        'least flatten a little on the top, about 2 hours.'
        '(Relax. It’s bread dough, not a newborn.'
        'You don’t need to monitor it constantly.'
        'And don’t worry about the dough being precisely double or triple'
        'its original volume as you would with a traditional bread recipe.'
        'Just walk away, go about your business, and come back in 2 hours. Seriously.)'
        )

    Step_3 = (
        '3. After 2 hours, stash the container of dough in the fridge.'
        'That’s it. (If your container isn’t vented, you want to ensure'
        'the gases can escape by leaving the cover open a crack for the'
        'first couple days in the fridge; after that, you can seal it.)'
        'You can use the dough anytime after the initial 2-hour rise,'
        'although the refrigerated wet dough is less sticky and easier'
        'to work with than dough at room temperature, so it’s best to'
        'refrigerate the dough overnight before handling it.'
        'Once refrigerated, the dough will seem to have shrunk back'
        'upon itself as though it will never rise again—that’s normal.'
        'Whatever you do, do not punch down this dough.'
        'You’re trying to retain as much gas in the dough as possible,'
        'and punching it down knocks gas out and results in denser loaves.'
        'Just be certain to use the dough at some point within 14 days.'
        )
